# Install Docker for Mac

Docker for Mac is a [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) (CE) app. The Docker for Mac install package includes everything you need to run Docker on a Mac. This topic describes pre-install considerations, and how to download and install Docker for Mac.

## Download Docker for Mac

If you have not already done so, please install Docker for Mac. You can download installers from the Stable or beta channel.

Both Stable and Edge installers come with experimental features in Docker Engine enabled by default and configurable on Docker Daemon preferences for experimental mode. We recommend that you disable experimental features for apps in production.

On both channels, we welcome your feedback to help us as the apps evolve.

For more about Stable and Edge channels, see the FAQs.
